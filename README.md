🎯 Ethical Object Detection with YOLO, Reinforcement Learning, and IoT Integration

📜 Overview

This project implements a framework for ethical and bias-aware object detection using the YOLOv3 model, integrating reinforcement learning (RL) and IoT data for real-time ethical decision-making. The system detects objects in images, assigns bias and ethical scores, and adjusts ethical priorities dynamically based on detected objects and environmental factors (e.g., GPS data). It uses reinforcement learning to adapt and improve ethical decision-making, evaluating the system using performance metrics like False Negative Rate (FNR) and False Positive Score (FPS).


🚀 Requirements

To get started, you'll need to install the following Python packages:


Python 3.x

OpenCV (cv2)

NumPy

Pandas

Matplotlib

TensorFlow

Install the dependencies by running:


bash

Copy
pip install opencv-python numpy pandas matplotlib tensorflow

📂 Files Needed

YOLOv3 weights (yolov3.weights): Download from YOLO website.

YOLOv3 config file (yolov3.cfg): Download from the same link as above.

coco.names file: This contains the class names used by YOLOv3 (e.g., person, car, bicycle). It can be found in the official YOLO repository.

💡 Code Description

🔍 Object Detection: The code uses YOLOv3 to detect objects in images. The model is loaded using OpenCV's cv2.dnn.readNet() function, and predictions are made on each image.


⚖️ Bias and Ethical Score Calculation: Based on the detected objects, the system calculates the Bias Score (using predefined risk factors) and Ethical Score (using predefined ethical factors for prioritizing safety).


🤖 Reinforcement Learning: An RL agent is used to adjust ethical priorities dynamically based on the detected objects and their ethical importance. The agent explores actions (adjusting or maintaining priorities) to ensure the system operates with an ethical decision-making framework.


🌍 IoT Integration: Real-time GPS data can be incorporated to adjust ethical priorities depending on the zone (e.g., prioritize pedestrian detection in pedestrian zones).


📊 Performance Metrics: The system evaluates its accuracy and fairness using metrics like False Negative Rate (FNR) and False Positive Score (FPS).


🔧 Functions

preprocess_image(img_path): Loads and preprocesses the image for YOLOv3.

detect_objects_in_image(img, blob, height, width): Detects objects in the image using YOLOv3 and applies non-maximum suppression (NMS).

calculate_bias_score(class_ids): Calculates the bias score based on the detected objects.

calculate_ethical_score(class_ids): Calculates the ethical score based on the detected objects.

input_ground_truth(img_name): Prompts the user to input the ground truth (true objects) for the image.

EthicalDecisionModel: A TensorFlow model used for reinforcement learning to adjust ethical decisions.

process_images_with_ethical_factor(image_files, gps_data): Processes multiple images, detects objects, and calculates bias, ethical scores, FNR, FPS, and visualizes the results.

🚀 Running the Code

To run the code, follow these steps:


Place the images you want to process in the all_data/ directory.

Make sure you have the YOLOv3 model weights, config, and the coco.names file in the working directory.

Run the script to process images and see the results.

bash
Copy
python ethical_object_detection.py

📊 Output

The output will be displayed in the console, showing a table with the following columns:


Image: The image file name.

Detected Objects: A dictionary of detected objects and their count.

Bias Score: The calculated bias score for the image.

Ethical Score: The calculated ethical score for the image.

FNR: The False Negative Rate.

FPS: The False Positive Score.

Difference with Ground Truth: Missing and extra detected objects.

GPS Data: The location information (if available).

Additionally, the script will show a plot of bias and ethical scores across the processed images.


📈 Bias and Ethical Score Visualization

The code generates a plot of the Bias and Ethical Scores for each image, giving insight into how the system prioritizes certain objects based on their ethical and risk considerations.


python

Copy

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))

plt.plot(range(len(bias_scores)), bias_scores, label="Bias Score", color="blue")

plt.plot(range(len(ethical_scores)), ethical_scores, label="Ethical Score", color="green")

plt.xlabel('Image Index')

plt.ylabel('Score')

plt.title('Bias and Ethical Scores Across Images')

plt.legend()

plt.show()
